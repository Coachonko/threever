Introducing threever, the revolutionary 3-based versioning system that will change the way you view 
software updates forever! 

Do you ever find yourself doubting the quality of software that begins with a version number of 0.x.x? 
It's a common misconception that a lower initial version number signifies an incomplete or unstable 
product. However, threever is here to change that perception and provide you with a software versioning 
system that's not only innovative but also a game-changer in the industry.

Embrace the Power of Positive Numbers

threever boldly flips the script by introducing a 3-based versioning system. With threever, you don't 
have to endure the awkward phase of "0.x.x" or "1.x.x," which often makes users wonder if the software 
is truly ready for prime time. Instead, you'll start right at "3.0.0," an unequivocal declaration of 
a strong, mature, and fully stable product right from the start.

Reclaim Your Confidence

The zero-based stigma can be discouraging for users and developers alike, leading to unwarranted skepticism 
about the readiness of software. With threever, that all changes. You'll enjoy the confidence of knowing 
that your software is a reliable, high-quality product ready to serve your needs, thanks to its impressive 
"3.x.x" version.

A Mark of Credibility

threever elevates your software's credibility. The version number "3.x.x" immediately commands respect 
and trust. Users can rest assured that your software has undergone extensive testing and development, 
providing them with a mature, reliable, and feature-rich experience.

Simplified and Consistent Versioning

Traditional versioning can sometimes be convoluted and hard to decipher. The 3-based approach employed by 
threever simplifies the versioning process. It starts at 3 and progresses seamlessly from there, giving 
developers a clear and consistent path for indicating progress and improvements.

Showcase Your Hard Work from the Start

With threever, developers have the opportunity to showcase the extensive effort and dedication they've 
poured into their software. There's no need to hide behind "0.x.x" versions or obscure the true progress 
made. Starting at "3.0.0" tells your users that your software is a labor of love that's worthy of their 
trust and investment.

In conclusion, threever offers a compelling solution to the age-old problem of zero-based versioning. By 
adopting this innovative approach, you not only gain an advantage in terms of credibility and user trust 
but also create a simplified and consistent versioning system that showcases your hard work right from the 
beginning.
